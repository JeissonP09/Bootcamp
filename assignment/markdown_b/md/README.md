# Markdown to Safe HTML Converter

This Go project converts Markdown files into safe, sanitized HTML using the `blackfriday` and `bluemonday` libraries.

## ðŸš€ What does this program do?

It reads a `.md` (Markdown) file, converts it to HTML, and then sanitizes the HTML content to remove any potentially harmful code (such as JavaScript injections), ensuring itâ€™s safe to display in a browser.

## ðŸ§© Technologies Used

- [`blackfriday/v2`](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday) â€“ Parses Markdown content into raw HTML.
- [`bluemonday`](https://github.com/microcosm-cc/bluemonday) â€“ Sanitizes the HTML output to prevent XSS and other security vulnerabilities.
- Standard Go packages: `os`, `fmt`, `io/ioutil`.
